<h1> Dolphins </h1>
<p> Dolphins are small-toothed cetaceans easily recognizable by their curved mouths, which give them a permanent smile. There are 38 dolphin species, found in every ocean.Most dolphins are marine and live in the ocean or brackish waters along coastlines. There are a few species, however, like the South Asian river dolphin and the Amazon river dolphin, or boto, that live in freshwater streams and rivers. </p>
